# This is a fan made dungeon editor for the King of Thieves game.

Created using Godot.



Here is some tips for the dungeon editor:

Tip1: You can rotate some traps/tools by clicking them a second time. However, if the trap/tool is not rotatable, the trap/tool will be removed. And if you rotate the trap/tool a total of 360 degrees, it will disappear. (The boards can rotate too.)

Tip2: Don't forget to check the options. You can edit some variables here!

Tip3: You can test the dungeon, if door is placed somewhere in the dungeon.
