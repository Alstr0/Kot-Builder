Info1: If you place a door, you can test the dungeon!

Info2: You can rotate some traps/tools by clicking them a second time. However, if the trap/tool is not rotatable, the trap/tool will be removed. And if you rotate the trap/tool a total of 360 degrees, it will disappear. (The boards can rotate!)

Info3: Don't forget to check the options. You can edit some variables here!
